# Background

You have spent your life dedicated to Oghma, all-seeing god of knowledge, and spent years learning the lore of the multiverse.

**Personal Goal: Reconsecrate the Defiled Alter** Through visions delivered in your trances, your god has called you to a new mission. A goblin tribe has made its lair in an ancient ruin now called Cragmaw Castle, where they have defiled a shrine once sacred to Oghma. Now dedicated to the vile goblin god Maglubiyet, the alter is an offense to Oghma that must not stand.

You're sure Oghma has greater things in store for you if you can complete this quest. In the meantime, your visions suggest that Sister Garacle --a priest of Tymora, the goddess of luck -- can aid you in the town of Phandalin.

**Alignment: Chaotic Good** The pursuit and acquisition of knowledge is the benefit for all. Kingdoms and laws are useful so far as they allow knowledge to flourish. Tyrants who seek to suppress and control it are the worst villains. You share your knowledge freely, and use what you have learned to help where you can.
