# Traits

## Personality Traits

I use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of erudition. Also I've spent so long in the temple that I have little experience dealing with people on a casual basis.

## Ideals

Knowledge. The path to power and self-improvement is through knowledge.

## Bonds

The tome I carry with me is the record of my life's work so far, and no vault is secure enough to keep it safe.

## Flaws

I'll do just about anything to uncover historical secrets that would add to my research.

## Features

**Spellcasting Ability** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells. The saving throw DC to resist a spell you cast is 13. Your attack bonus when you make an attack with a spell is +5. See the rulebook for rules on casting your spells.

**Arcane Recovery** You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day during a short rest, you can choose to recover expended spell slots with a combined level equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up).

**Dark Vision** You can see in dim light within a 60-foot radius of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness in that radius as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Fey Ancestry** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Trance** Elves don't need to sleep. They meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious for 4 hours a day and gain the same benefit a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

**Shelter of the Faithful** As as servant of Oghma, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the rites of Oghma. You and your companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of Oghma's faith. Those who share your religion will support you (and only you) at modest lifestyle. You also have ties to the temple of Oghma in Neverwinter, where you have residence. When you are in Neverwinter, you can call upon the priests there for assistance that wont endanger them.
