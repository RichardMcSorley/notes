# Gaining Levels

As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.

With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d6+2 to your hit point maximum.

You gain access to more spells as you gain levels. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your level + your Intelligence, as shown in the Spellcasting Advancement table. You also gain more spell slots.

## Spellcasting Advancement

Level | Prepared Spells | 1st | 2nd | 3rd
--|---|--|--|--
2nd | 5 | 3 
3rd | 6 | 4 | 2
4th | 8 | 4 | 3
5th | 9 | 4 | 3 | 2

## Adding Spells to your Spellbook

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook, chosen from the wizard spell list in the rulebook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. On your adventures, you might also find scrolls or books containing other spells you can add to your spellbook.

**Copying a Spell into the book.** When you find a wizard spell, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and requires 50gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fin inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

## 2nd Level: 300 XP

**Evocation Savant**. The gold and time you must spend to copy a evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
**Sculpt Spells**. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they normally take half damage from it.

## 3rd Level: 900 XP

**Spells.** You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells.

## 4th Level: 2,700 XP

**Spells.** You can learn one more wizard cantrip of your choice.

- Your Intelligence modifier becomes +4

- Your bonus for your spell attacks increases by 1.

## 5th Level: 6,500 XP

**Spells**. You can prepare and cast 3rd level spells.
**Proficiency Bonus** Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:
- Your attack bonus increases by 1 for your spell attacks and weapons you're proficient with.
- Your spell saving throw DC increases by 1
- Your modifier for saving throws and skills you're proficient in (indicated by **bold text**) increases by 1.
- Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.
